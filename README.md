Phase 1: Industrial Revolution and Factories

The first phase of business evolution was marked by the Industrial Revolution, 
where factories and mass production took center stage. Rich individuals and entrepreneurs led the charge, 
establishing factories to meet the rising demands for goods in a mechanized world.

Phase 2: Digitalization and Technology

The second phase saw the rise of digitalization and technology adoption. 
Businesses embraced computers, software, and digital platforms to streamline 
operations and reach global markets. Giants like Google, Meta (formerly Facebook), 
and Apple emerged, becoming data-driven entities, and transparency in business became a concern.

Solution: Phase 3 - Introducing Community-Driven Businesses

Enter Phase 3, a novel approach to business called community-driven businesses. 
TMK is pioneering this idea, where businesses are autonomously run by people 
through a decentralized blockchain mechanism. Imagine a platform where everything 
is transparently displayed, and customers decide how to run the organization by voting.

In a TMK-powered ecosystem, power shifts to the customers, moving away from 
centralized control. Through the voting mechanism, customers play a vital role 
in shaping the business's decisions, ensuring a more inclusive and transparent approach.

With community-driven businesses, the focus shifts back to the people, 
fostering trust and cooperation. By embracing this revolutionary concept, 
TMK aims to create a more transparent and honest ecosystem that empowers 
its users and customers like never before.


Imagine how Uber operates with centralized power, where they decide 
the prices based on various factors like city, weather, and your job. 
Now, envision TMKcabs, a community-driven alternative. 
Here, people have a say in determining the fair and genuine fare for rides, 
benefiting both passengers and cab owners.

In the TMK ecosystem, there's a strict protocol built into the software (blockchain), 
ensuring that fares never increase by more than 20% in a year. So, while Uber may 
raise its fare from 100rs to 150rs during the rainy season, 
TMKcabs will keep its fare steady at 120rs.

This approach empowers the community and prioritizes fairness, 
providing a reliable and transparent ride-hailing service where everyone's voice matters. 
With TMKcabs, you can enjoy rides without worrying about sudden price hikes, making the 
experience pleasant for both passengers and drivers alike.


The abvoe is just one example to explain you the possibility of the impact that
we can create with tmkcogni blockchain and the fact is 
the solutions with tmkcogni are endless
